### Randomized experiments {.tabset}

#### Estimation

Formally, we can write the outcome of each unit in either the treatment or control group using the following notation [@deaton2018understanding]:

#### Average treatment effects (ATE)

Researchers are typically interested in the average treatment effect (ATE), which is the **average causal effect** of a variable (e.g. a message to induce social pressure) **on an outcome** variable (e.g. voting) for the entire study population.

In the classical experimental design the ATE can be estimated as the **difference in means** of the outcome **between the treatment and control groups**.

Formally, we can take the **average of the treatment group** ($T=1$) and **the control group** ($T=0$) to estimate the **ATE**:

![](images/ATE.png)

$\hat{\beta}{1}$ is the **average treatment effect**; the subscript indicates that this estimate calculates the average of the treatment effects in the treatment group. The second term is the **“error term”** of the ATE estimate: **the average difference between treatment and control group that is unrelated to treatment** (from observable and unobservable differences).

#### What does randomization do?
![](images/ATE.png)

Conceptually, randomization simply means that **every experimental unit has the same probability of being assigned** to a given group.

Randomized assignment of treatment and control ensures that the $\hat{x}_{j}$ are **uncorrelated** with the **treatment assignment,** and so the ATE estimate is expected to be **unbiased**.

If we were to repeat the experiment with many $N$-sized samples, the **average error term would be zero** and and the average of $\hat{\beta}{1}$ would be **equal to the ATE.**

#### How it works?
![](images/ATE.png)

In any given sample, the error term will **likely not be zero** and $\hat{\beta}{1}$ will not be equal to the ATE. However, as the sample size $N$ grows, the variance of both around their true means decreases. As a result, **a larger sample size increases the statistical power** for tests about the ATE.

In most settings, **the elements of the error term are not known** or completely observed which makes **randomization** **valuable** as it **ensures** that the **error term is zero** in expectation.

**Balance** means that the distribution of those $\hat{x}_{ij}$ in the treatment group is similar to that in the control group.

Randomization doesn’t guarantee perfect balance. It **guarantees no systematic bias**.

#### Group Means in Voting.csv

```{r load, echo=FALSE}
voting <- read.csv("data/voting.csv")

voting$pressure <- ifelse(voting$message == "yes", 1L, 0L)
```

```{r ggplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Dataset: voting.csv"}
ggplot(voting, aes(x = factor(pressure), y = birth)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "grey80") +
  labs(x = "Treatment group (0 = Control, 1 = Treated)",
       y = "Year of birth",
       title = "Comparison of Year of Birth (covariate) in Treatment \n and Control Groups")
```
